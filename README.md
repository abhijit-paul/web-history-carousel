# web-history-carousel
Seamless web browser that combines mostly visited/history and the actual website load in a single screen.
By default see the tiles of mostly viewed websites and history of websites visited.
You write in search bar, the history and tiles start getting narrowed down based on the search
Once you establish a valid URL, the tiles and history area shorten up and you see website loading there.
