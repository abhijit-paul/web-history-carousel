# web-history-carousel
Seamless web browser that combines mostly visited/history and the actual website load in a single screen.

By default see the tiles of mostly viewed websites and history of websites visited.
You type in search bar: the history and tiles start getting narrowed down based on the search
Once you establish a valid URL, the tiles and history area shorten up and you see website loading on the right hand side.
Once you hover over any tile or history, that webpage start loading up and you see the website loading.
How does tile look like: Website snapshot.
When I say shorten up: The tile size decreases and becomes favicon.ico
